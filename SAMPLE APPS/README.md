# Sample Apps

As with many of my repos, this is a learning-based solo project to enhance my React and React-Native skills. Feel free to contribute and enjoy the notes and snippets below. Be sure to check out the sample apps in [THIS](https://github.com/mathcodes/react-native-goals-app/tree/main/sample-apps) directory.

```
yarn
```
```
yarn start
```

You should something similar to the following in your terminal explaining how to launch the app on your device or emulator:
