So now with that, we got this value and now we can pass this to our context provider, by setting the value prop, which is expected by that provider, equal to our value constant. So now this value here, simply refers to this value constant here; So to this object. And we're passing this object as a value, into our context provider. And that means that now all the components that are wrapped by this context provider. So in our case, since we're wrapping everything, all components, we'll be able to tap into this context and either call these functions or read our IDs.
