So in meal detail screen, we can pass favorites context into use context. And for this, of course you need to make sure that you import favorites context. Now with that imported, we got hold of our favorite meals context, and with we now can do a couple of things. For example, we can find out whether that meal currently is our favorite or not or one of our favorites. And I even wanna change the icon that we show here on the detail screen based on that information.
