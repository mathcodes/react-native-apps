// BLOCK SUMMARY:
// In the ExpensesContextProvider component here, we added all these functions which dispatch our actions. Now we also need to construct a value object here, which bundles all our data and these functions together, to expose them to all the interested components, through that provider component down there:
// return <ExpensesContext.Provider value={value} >{children}</ExpensesContext.Provider>// children is the component that is being wrapped

// HERE WE ARE dispatching different actions and these different actions will lead to different state changes inside of expensesReducer.
// The job of the reducer is to take the current state and an action and return a new state value, either the existing state or a new state when we make it into one of the cases we created.
function ExpensesContextProvider({ children }) { // children is the component that is being wrapped
  // expensesState is being managed by this reducer and is now made available to the component that is being wrapped
  // And the second element -  dispatch a new action to the reducer function - manipulate the state 
  // - which we then get as a new state in this component function, which will be reevaluated if the state changes automatically all thanks to React and this hook.
  const [expensesState, dispatch] = useReducer(expensesReducer, DUMMY_EXPENSES); // useReducer is a hook that takes a reducer and returns an array of two elements. The first element/parameter is our expensesState (the state that will be managed by our reducer now made available in this component function. The second element/parameter will be a dipatch function which we can execute to dispatch a new action to the reducer function which will manipulate the state and give us a new state which will be reevaluated if the state changes automatically.
  
  // This const [expensesState, dispatch] is now available to the component that is being wrapped and is set to the useReducer hook where we pass in the expensesReducer function and the DUMMY_EXPENSES array. THIS IS HOW WE KNOW THE UPDATED STATE WILL STILL BE AN ARRAY

  // note we are NOT using object desctructuring, instead the parameter itself should be named expenseData.

  // SO HERE WE ARE forwarding the incoming expense data to our reducer function by dispatching this action.
  function addExpense(expenseData) {
    dispatch({ // here we call dispatch, a function that takes an action object as an argument:
      type: 'ADD', // the action passed into expenseReducer is the type of the action
      payload: expenseData, // the payload is the data that we want to pass into the reducer function. We also forward the expenseData object that we are passing in (without object destructuring)
    });
  }

  function deleteExpense(id) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'DELETE',
      payload: id,
    });
  }

  function updateExpense(id, expenseData) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'UPDATE',
      payload: { id: id, data: expenseData }, // here we are passing in an object with an id and an object of expenseData
    });
  }

  const value = {
    expenses: expensesState,// a expenses key and point at my expensesState which is returned by useReducer, and which is recreated whenever action is dispatched,
    addExpense: addExpense, // then add the addExpense function, and point at the addExpense function here, so the right side of the colon is referring to the different functions we defined above, and therefore I also added deleteExpense function here and point at deleteExpense and add an updateExpense method and point at updateExpense.
    deleteExpense: deleteExpense,
    updateExpense: updateExpense,
  }
// NOW, TO MAKE THIS value AVAILABLE TO ALL COMPONENTS, WE SET THE value prop on this Context Provider component down there, and setting this equal to this value directly above. Now this custom provider component:
// `function ExpensesContextProvider({ children }) {`
// can be wrapped around all the components that are interested in this context.
  return <ExpensesContext.Provider value={value} >{children}</ExpensesContext.Provider>// children is the component that is being wrapped
}

export default ExpensesContextProvider;

// Now this custom provider component can be wrapped around all the components that are interested in this context.
