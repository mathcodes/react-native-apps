The second step of course is to connect this Confirm button. For this, I'll add another function here which I'll name confirmInputHandler. And the idea here is that we then check the current state that we have, we check if it's a number and if it's greater or equal than one and smaller or equal than 99 because I only wanna allow numbers in that range. And then we proceed to the next screen if it's valid and we show an alert, otherwise.
