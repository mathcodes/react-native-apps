    function deleteGoalHandler(){
      console.log("deleteGoalHandler");
    } // now we use a pointer in the GoalInput component below to pass the deleteGoalHandler as a value to the onDeleteItem prop 
  // and another handler to fire when the button is clicked

  // Now we want the value entered in the TextInput in this `addGoalHandler` function. So what we need to do is we need to store it as state, which is updated with every keystroke in the `goalInputHandler` function so that we can then use it in the `addGoalHandler` function.
  function addGoalHandler(enteredGoalText) {
    // We COULD use the spread operator like so:
 // setCourseGoals([...courseGoals, enteredGoalText]);
    // BUT when your state relies on previous state, passing a function to the state-changing function to derive the new state as it automatically receives the current state by React :)
    // So now we're updating this course goal state based on the old course goals by appending a new goal.

// Turning our items into objects with keys but changing `enteredGoalText` into just that:
// After making our components, the problem is that this enteredGoalText is eventually needed in the App component, when 
// we add a new goal. and therefore we also need to make sure that this data arrives here in addGoalHandler. { text: 
// enteredGoalText, key: Math.random().toString() },
//  SOLUTION : The easiest way of ensuring this would be to expect the enteredGoalText as a parameter:
//    function addGoalHandler(enteredGoalText) {


  // We will use event listening props provided by react native on its components, such as:
  // onChangeText prop which takes in a pointer to a function
